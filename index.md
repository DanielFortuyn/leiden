## Some tips for fun places in Leiden
As an Airbnb host it is nice to share some places we like to visit in Leiden. What I have compiled so far is a list of activities, bars, restaurants and events we can recommend as citizens.

### Bars
So, first things first, what are some nice bars to visit in Leiden:

#### De Bonte Koe
Traditional place which is a well known place in Leiden. We think it is absolutly worth the visit. It is primarily a good place to visit if you just want to have a drink.

#### De Spiegels
Nice Jazzy cafe with live music from time to time. It has quite the international crowd and is recommended by us.

#### De Uyl
Nice caf√© with a twenty five plus public, great place to experience some typical night out for dutch people.

### Restaurants
If you do not want to use our *old* kitchen we can recommend some restaurants.

#### Bhudda's 
As the name suggests it is a thai food place, which we really like. If you want thai takeaway we can recommend tappa thai in the Steenstraat.

#### In den doofpot
If you are looking for a fancy place to have a great dining experience this place comes in highly recommended.

### Breakfast & coffee
One of the things we really like to do is to go out for breakfast. So far we have tried two places because we absolutely enjoy our time there.

#### Lot & De Walvis
We like the sunday recovery breakfast. We can truly recommend it, but from time to time it can be crowded and sometimes there are some children as well.

#### Van der Leur
Great coffee and a nice plate for breakfast aswell. If you go there you will probably take more than one cup of coffee. 

### Things to do

#### Musea
Leiden is literally packed with musea so do not miss the opportunity to visit the natural history, the general history or the cultural history musea. The last two we can personally recommend.

#### Daytrips - Rotterdam
Instead of going to Amsterdam visit Rotterdam for a change. It was european cultural city a couple of years ago and we really enjoy goign there.
