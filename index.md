## Some tips for fun places in Leiden
As an Airbnb host it is nice to share some places we like to visit in Leiden. What I have compiled so far is a list of activities, bars, restaurants and events we can recommend as citizens.

### Bars
---
So, first things first, what are some nice bars to visit in Leiden:

#### De Bonte Koe
Traditional place which is a well known place in Leiden. We think it is absolutly worth the visit. It is primarily a good place to visit if you just want to have a drink.

#### De Spiegels
Nice Jazzy cafe with live music from time to time. It has quite the international crowd and is recommended by us.

#### De Uyl
Nice bar with a twenty five plus public, great place to experience some typical night out for dutch people.


### Restaurants & Takeaway
---
If you do not want to use our *old* kitchen we can recommend some restaurants.

#### Bhudda's 
As the name suggests it is a thai food place, which we really like. If you want thai takeaway we can recommend tappa thai in the Steenstraat.

#### In den doofpot
If you are looking for a fancy place to have a great dining experience this place comes in highly recommended.

### Breakfast & coffee
---
One of the things we really like to do is to go out for breakfast. So far we have tried two places because we absolutely enjoy our time there.

#### Lot & De Walvis
We like the sunday recovery breakfast. We can truly recommend it, but from time to time it can be crowded and sometimes there are some children as well. The location in the harbour is very nice.

#### Van der Leur
Great coffee and a nice plate for breakfast aswell. If you go there you will probably take more than one cup of coffee. It is about halfway in the breestraat, near the magnificent city hall. 

### Things to do
Of course you need to entertain yourselves while you are here.

#### Musea
Leiden is literally packed with musea so do not miss the opportunity to visit the natural history, the general history or the cultural history musea. The last two we can personally recommend.

#### Boat trip Leidsche Rederij
Taking a boattrip with the Leidsche Rederij is very nice, we have done so at least three times and learned some new stuff about our City every time. 

#### 'hofjes' tour
Leiden has many 'hofjes' which you can visit walking through the city. A 'hofje' are a set of houses with a shared enterance (gate) and a garden in the middle. We think it is quite a Dutch phenomenon, so please do not miss out on anything and see this awesome part of the city. 

#### Daytrips - Rotterdam
Instead of going to Amsterdam visit Rotterdam for a change. It was european cultural city a couple of years ago and we really enjoy going there.

### Terrassen (bonus)
If the wheater is good. Do what all dutch people to, go into the city and sit outside to have a drink. It is the dutch equivalent of a beergarden. We can recommend the following locations. If you are going, please do not forget to order the typical dutch **BITTERBALLEN** it is a treat and should not be missed!!

#### Annies & De Nieuwe Rijn
Along de nieuwe rijn there are many terraces, it is the go-to location for dutch people. definetly worth the visit. Top of the bill however is the terrace of *annies verjaardag*. It is a floating terrace at the conjunction of both parts of the old river. It is not specifically good, but a nice place to visit. Watch out, if the sun is out, it is probably full.

#### Babbels
A bit out of the way, but has a great location where there are usually some spots left. On the route there you probably pass 't Keizertje which is another nice place.

#### Lot & De Walvis
Great place to have breakfast, but drinks can totally work as well.
